###How to Program
- DIP Switch Explanation by /u/Neralo on Reddit :::

   ===============================================
   
   Let me translate what I can. First time playing with tables, so excuse any formatting issues.
   
   First off, lets take a look at the **DIP Switches**
   
   DIP Switch | Function | Function when off | Function when on
   ---|---|----|----|----
   Switch 1 | Swap Caps Lock and Left Control  | **Button's function normally**. Caps is Caps, left Ctrl is left Ctrl | **Buttons functions switched.** Caps Lock = Left Ctrl, Left Ctrl = Caps Lock
   Switch 2 | Swap Win Key and Fn | **Keys function normally,** Win is Win, Fn is Fn | **Key Functions switched,** Win is Fn, Fn is Win. 
   Switch 3 | Lock Win Key | Win Key **unlocked**, pressing it opens start menu | Win Key **locked**, will not do anything. 
   
   This next section is for the escape key functions. Note that the combination **FN+Q** will switch the functions slightly. Its noted in the table below.
   
   
   Key Combination | Normal Result | After Fn+Q
   ---|---|----
   Just ESC | ESC | `
   Shift+ESC | ~ | ~
   Fn+ESC | ` | ESC
   
   
   Finally, lets look at the **Fn Layer** properly. 
   
   
   Key Combination | Function | Key Combination | Function
   ---|---|----|----
   Fn+W | Polling rate 20C/S | Fn+; | Home
   Fn+E | Polling rate: 40C/S | Fn+/ | End
   Fn+R | Polling Rate 60C/S | Fn+Page Up | Home
   Fn+1 to = | F1 - F12 | Fn+Page Down | End
   Fn+Z | Launch default media app | Fn+O | Print Screen/SysReq
   Fn+X | Play/Pause | Fn+P | Scroll Lock
   Fn+C | Stop | Fn+[ | Pause Break
   Fn+V | Previous Song | Fn+] | Calculator
   Fn+B | Next Song | Fn+Up arrow | Increase LED Brightness
   Fn+N | Volume Down | Fn+Down arrow | Lower LED brightness, keep pressing to turn them off
   Fn+M | Volume Up | Fn+Left Arrow | On/Off LED Breathing Mode
   Fb+< | Mute | Fn+Right arrow | LED Breathing mode speed 
   
   
   Feel free to let me know if there's anything else you'd like to know, or if you've got other questions. 

   Source: I own the magicforce 68, and I'm fluent in mandarin.

- Replace the PCB and make your MagicForce fully programmable via QMK! [More info here](https://github.com/di0ib/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/keyboard/mf68)<br>
- Another way to make your MagicForce fully programmable is to handwire it to a Andruino Micro. [More info here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/magicforce68)<br>
