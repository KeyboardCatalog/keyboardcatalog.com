###How to Program
- A [github repo](https://github.com/GonzaloAlvarez/ifd68) has been created to attempt to recreate some more resources on thise keyboard as the origins are hazy. He has included the original programming Windows program that you can download and attempt to program your board with. 
   - I downloaded the github repo and re-hosted here just in case it goes down. [Download the .zip](ifd68-master.zip)
